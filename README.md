# Streamlit-based Recommender System


## 1) Overview



Recommender systems are the unsung heroes of our modern technological world. Search engines, online shopping, streaming multimedia platforms, news-feeds - all of these services depend on recommendation algorithms in order to provide users the content they want to interact with.

At a fundamental level, these systems operate using similarity, where we try to match people (users) to things (items). Two primary approaches are used in recommender systems are content-based and collaborative-based filtering.  In content-based filtering this similarity is measured between items based on their properties, while collaborative filtering uses similarities amongst users to drive recommendations.
